    <h1>TYPE VI SIGNATURE INTERCONNECT</h1>
    <p>
      The Signature version of the Vi takes the performance of the Vi to an even higher level.
      PTFE and helium are used as the dielectric.
      Helium is a noble gas which does not accept electrons from the signal wire as the electricity flows through the cable.
      This prevents smearing of the transients because the energy is not stored in the dielectric and later released.
      The transients are therefore crisper and low level details more clear.
      The Signature also uses WBT Nextgen copper RCA connectors or Cardas XLR connectors for better signal conduction and less skin effect.
