    <h1>DIGITAL CABLE</h1>
    <p>
    The Magnan digital cable uses the same micro thin conductor technology to minimize skin effect distortion as the Vi Signature.
    The construction is optimized for digital signal transmission and to provide the proper impedance.
    The cables are shielded from electromagnetic interference and from airborne vibrations.
    PTFE and helium dielectric is used to minimize energy storage.
    WBT connectors are standard for RCA, Cardas connectors for XLR.
    The minimum and standard length is 6.5 feet.
