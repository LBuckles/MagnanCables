    <h2> Magnan Cables Are Unique </h2>
    <p>
      Magnan interconnects and speaker cables drastically reduce skin effect-caused time dispersion or time smear in conductors.
      The Magnan cables combine micro-thin alloy ribbon technologies with air space/PTFE (Teflon) dielectric construction.
      All Magnan audio cables are completely made by hand — these designs cannot be made by machine.
      Many hours go into the construction of these audio cables before final inspection, testing, and evaluation.
